This website was developed entirely using **Google's Antigravity IDE**, leveraging a modern **React + Next.js** stack.

## A Familiar Yet Powerful Experience

Antigravity is essentially a **VS Code clone**, but it's a really good one. It feels immediately familiar to any developer who has used VS Code, but with supercharged AI capabilities baked right into the core.

As of **November 2025**, it's currently free to use. I've been powering my development with the **Gemini 3 Pro** model, which has been incredibly impressive. For those who prefer other flavors of AI, there's also the option to switch to **Claude Sonnet** or **GPT-OSS** models, giving developers flexibility in their AI tooling.

## Agentic Capabilities

What sets Antigravity apart is its "Agentic" nature. It's not just code completion; it's a pair programmer that can perform complex tasks.

### Native Browser Testing

One of the standout features is the ability to test the website you are building by launching a **Chrome browser** instance (via a plugin). The agent can navigate your site, scroll, click, and verify UI elements, effectively performing tasks similar to **Selenium UI automated tests** but driven by natural language instructions.

### Native Image Generation

Need assets? Antigravity has the ability to **natively generate images** using Google's latest image generation models. I used this feature to create the abstract 3D visuals and the logo for this very site, all without leaving the IDE.

## Planning Mode: A Game Changer

I've been using the **Planning Mode**, which feels similar to Cursor 2 but even more refined. I really like it. The workflow is wonderful:

1.  It creates a detailed **Implementation Plan**.
2.  It creates a **Task List** and ticks off items one-by-one as it executes them.
3.  Finally, it generates a **Walkthrough** explaining exactly what it achieved.

This structured approach keeps the development focused and transparent.

## Final Verdict

Overall, I've come away really impressed. It's a powerful tool that streamlines the process of building simple to complex websites.

> It's not without its issues, obviously—there are some bugs that need to be iterated over and fixed, but that's to be expected with such cutting-edge technology.

I do wonder how much it will cost in the future, but for now, it's a fantastic addition to the developer's toolkit.
